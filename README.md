# weather-dashboard
This is a simple weather dashboard that allows a user to enter a city and get current weather conditions as well as the conditions for the next 5 days. It includes temperature, wind speed, and humidity. This dashboard also saves your searches so you can go back and click them if you wanted to see the weather conditions for a previously searched city once again.


## Getting Started

To start simply click the link below to get started. Then enter a city in the search input and grab the current and future weather conditions for that particular city.
